* Before  installing the oracle database it’s a good practice to update the package lists on your system  using the update command.
sudo apt update
	* To Clone the repository to your server use the following command.
git clone https://github.com/oracle/docker-images.git
	  

* The repository has been successfully cloned to our server
cd docker-images/
	* Go to the docker-images  as shown below.
  

cd docker-images/OracleDatabase/SingleInstance/dockerfiles/19.3.0/ls
	  

* Download the Oracle Database 19c binary from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/enterprise-edition/downloads/index.html

	* Once the oracle database 19c binary is downloaded. You can build the image.
  



./buildcontainerimage.sh -e -v 19.3.0
	* With the command provided above, you can build the oracle docker image.
  

* Once the image has been downloaded successfully. You can create the docker container using the docker image.
docker run -d --name oracle2  -p 1521:1521 -p 5500:5500 -e ORACLE_SID=ORCL -e ORACLE_PDB=ORCLCDB -e ORACLE_PWD=Chandu0616 oracle/database:19.3.0-ee 
	* Check the docker container using docker ps command.
  

docker logs  -f 7a1df482fc8f
	  

* Once the docker container has been running we can connect to the oracle database using the following command.
docker  exec -it oracle2 /bin/bash
	  

* After that you need to run the sqlplus command with username and password.
sqlplus sys/Chandu0616@ORCL as sysdba
	  

* Once the user is created you can connect to the sql developer tool using username and password.
  

* After  logging in  to the sql developer you can create another user using the following  command.
SELECT NAME, PDB 
 FROM V$SERVICES 
 ORDER BY PDB, NAME;
 
ALTER SESSION SET CONTAINER = ITVORCLPDB;
CREATE USER etl_user IDENTIFIED BY Itversity123;
GRANT CONNECT TO etl_user;
GRANT CREATE SESSION TO etl_user;
ALTER USER etl_user QUOTA UNLIMITED ON USERS;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES TO etl_user IDENTIFIED BY Itversity123;


	



  

* Once a new user is created we can connect to the new user using the following command.
